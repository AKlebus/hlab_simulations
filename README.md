### Seminar Abstract
This seminar is all about dealing with the unknown. We explore particularly how we can update your beliefs after receiving new information, and how our updated beliefs can guide decision making under uncertainty. We explore and discover these concepts through interactive games and thought experiments, and formalize these discovered concepts with some light mathematics. We see how these concepts can guide decisions in real-world problems, as well as how they relate to our own lives.

I hope that students who take this seminar come away with a new perspective on probability, belief, and decision making. I hope this perspective demystifies how uncertain real-world problems can be solved in a principled way. I also hope that students find these perspectives useful in their own lives, whether in updating their beliefs or making decisions. Finally, I hope to inspire students to look at math more as a beautiful and useful tool rather than as a painful but necessary part of their educational curriculum.
